# Hi! This is my repo with #reactJS learning exercises

## To see the exercises in your browser:

First, run

```
npm start
```

Then, uncomment the code that you want to see on **index.js**


For example, uncomment code for *HalfPage* component

```javascript
import HalfPage from './HalfPage/index';
import './HalfPage/HalfPage.css';
ReactDOM.render(<HalfPage />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
and comment code for *ItemList* component

```javascript
// import ItemList from './ItemList/index';
// import './ItemList/ItemList.css';
// ReactDOM.render(<ItemList />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## This is the list of exercises. Each of them is a component:
1. ItemList

2. HalfPage

3. OnionHater
