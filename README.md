# Hi! This is my repo with #reactJS learning exercises

## To see the exercises in your browser:

First, run

```
`npm start` or `yarn start`
```

Then, uncomment the code that you want to see on **App.js**


For example, uncomment code for *OnionHater* component

```javascript
<h2>Exercise 3. OnionHater</h2>
<OnionHater />
```
and comment code for *BlueSquare* component

```javascript
{/* <h2>Exercise 6. BlueSquare</h2>
<BlueSquare /> */}
```

## This is the list of exercises. Each of them is a component in src folder:
1. ItemList

2. HalfPage

3. OnionHater

4. Destiny

5. InputMirror

6. BlueSquare

7. SpaceShips

8. BtnBase -- Practice with Node Modules
