# Hi! This is my repo with #reactJS learning exercises

## To see the exercises in your browser:

First, run

```
`npm start` or `yarn start`
```

Then, uncomment the code that you want to see on **index.js**


For example, uncomment code for *HalfPage* component

```javascript
import HalfPage from './HalfPage';
ReactDOM.render(<HalfPage />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
and comment code for *ItemList* component

```javascript

```
